Use the GitHub link provided to access the files.

##Operation
Please check out what I was able to finish and consider giving a struggling coding student a passing grade! I njoyed everythign and as soon as I turn this it I am going back to the very beginning and doing everything again. I also owe you all a TestDome (and some feedback forms?). 

#Files
This will include the assemblies for the Komodo Cafe, Komodo Claims, and Komodo Outings Challenge prompts, because in my haste I did not realize only three were needed!

##Known Bugs
Ran out of time!
Yesterday my first challenge was working fine! Today of course it kept giving me problems with a 'make read only' message. I obessesed over this for sometime and I just could not figure out why it would not work until I discovered a setting with Visual Studio. I am not sure how this setting was changed, but Murphy's Law, right? 

#Troubleshooting
I am just having some fun with this readme at this point and I recommend taking a hammer to these applications!

#Credits
Thanks to Adam and Joshua for leading the course and the one on one check ins. Thanks to Ben for meeting with me during my group check ins.

##Changelog
Other than me frantically trying to figure out why I was suddenly getting build errors after having a working application, no changes.

#News
That's all for now.
